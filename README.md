# French layout on US QWERTY keyboards
A keyboard layout for typing french diacritics and ligatures for users with QWERTY keyboards.

# Introduction
When we want to type in french and we're using the US QWERTY keyboard. 
The choices we have are either the US International layout, Canadian Multilingual layout, or using the French AZERTY layout.
The Canadian Multilingual layout and the French AZERTY layout both contains keys that are mismatched from the US QWERTY keyboard.
The US International layout uses `'`, `"`, `\``, `~`, `^` as dead keys which becomes inconvenient when we want to type these characters frequently.
